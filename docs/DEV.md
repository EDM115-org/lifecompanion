**DISCLAIMER : LifeCompanion was a running project long before opening its source code to the community. Some parts may be : unoptimized, dirty, untested, weird... We are aware that some code, build, deployment could be improved, but as the development is heavely prioritized and constrained by costs, only some key features are focused on ðŸ˜Š That said, you're welcome to contribute !**

# Environments

There is three configured environment in LifeCompanion. Env are a good way to test and deploy updates before production.

| ID		| Description													|
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|**local**	|developper local env on his own machine						|
|**dev**	|staging environment to test on production configuration		|
|**prod**	|production configuration										|

Each of these environment has its own configuration to be runned and to be deployed on. It is possible to create a full running architecture for each env (update server, launcher, installer, app)

When calling specific Gradle script to deploy updates (see [Creating updates](#user-content-creating-updates)), you can inject env with `-Penv=prod` argument to Gradle commands. Default environment is always `local`

# Branches and tags organization on GitHub

LifeCompanion uses branches and tags to organize its repo.

| Name			| Description																					 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**main**		|main and clean source branch, last published version are on this branch				         |
|**develop**	|current development branch, all fixes and things feature merges are on this branch				 |
|**feature/\***	|individual branches created for specific feature 												 |

Tags are used for releases, tags are created are composed of : project, sub-project, version, env.

Example : `lifecompanion/lc-app/1.0.0-prod` describe LifeCompanion application version 1.0.0 in production env.

Tags are detailled in [Creating updates](#user-content-creating-updates) section (with naming strategy).

# Development

Development environment installed and tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu.

## Build and run projects

### How to install projects in IntelliJ

1. Download **JDK 16** for your platform : [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
1. Configuration Gradle to run with the installed JDK (**~/.gradle/gradle.properties** : add *org.gradle.java.home*)
1. This can sometimes be useful to configure **JAVA_HOME** env configuration
1. Install **[IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/)** (> 2019.2.4)
1. Open  **lifecompanion-framework** project : File > Open
1. Add module **lifecompanion** : File > New > Module from existing sources

	1. Project SDK : add the downloaded JDK path
1. Configure **IntelliJ Gradle JDK** : File > Settings
	1. Build > Gradle
	1. Build JVM : Project SDK (16) (on both module)

### How to build/run LifeCompanion application

1. Build and publish **lifecompanion-framework** libs : run task `gradlew publishToMavenLocal` in **lifecompanion-framework**
1. Copy **data** folder from an official LifeCompanion installation in **lifecompanion/lc-app/data** - (you can copy it from S3 resource bucket, if you have access to it)
1. Copy **installation.properties** and **launcher.properties** from **resources/default-data** to **lifecompanion/lc-app/data**
1. In **installation.properties** change **userDataDirectory** to your a wanted path (e.g. *My Documens/LifeCompanion-Dev*)
1. Run task `gradlew :lc-app:run` in **lifecompanion**

### How to build/run LifeCompanion update server

1. Install **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** and run it
1. Configure **PostgreSQL** with a dedicated database
1. Check port and database in **lc-framework-server/build.gradle** (in *applicationDefaultJvmArgs**)
1. Run task `gradlew :lc-framework-server:run` in **lc-framework-server**
1. First run will create tables on database
1. To insert default data, see [Deploy LifeCompanion server update in production](#user-content-deploy-lifecompanion-server-update-in-production)

### How to build/run Win SAPI Voice Synthesizer GAP

1. Install **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/)**
1. Open project in Visual Studio

If you want to build a custom version : you can disable security certificate.
If you want to build a production version : you may need to import again the security certificate (password is in LifeCompanion KeePass)

### How to build/run Win Input GAP

1. Install **[AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)** (tested with 1.1.33.10)
1. Modify or compile your script (you can use LifeCompanion ico)

## Troubleshooting

### Bad encoding on Windows dev env

1. For IntelliJ, in **idea64.exe.vmoptions** file, add two lines : `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` and `-Dconsole.encoding=UTF-8`
1. For Gralde, in **HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties**, add one line : `org.gradle.jvmargs=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dconsole.encoding=UTF-8`

### Note on Gradle command

Note that in the following document, when we say "run gradle task... in XXX" you should then run the gradle task in the given folder (lifecompanion or lifecompanion-framework) from your command line or IDE.
For example, to run LifeCompanion from command line : `cd lifecompanion` then `gradle :lc-app:run`

## Updates build env

To build LifeCompanion updates (on app, installer, launcher, server...) you should have configured various properties.

### Base configuration

Most of the gradle properties are already configured in *lifecompanion/gradle.properties*

The properties that can be changed depending on your local machine are :

- **innosetup.path** : path to InnoSetup installation
- **lc.build.resources.directory** : path to the software resource directory (when publishing updates) - this path can be absolute or relative to *lifecompanion/lc-app*

Other properties are configured for default environments, but can be changed

### Target environment configuration

Target environments are configured in **env** directory. When you first run LifeCompanion, it will automatically create **env/.env.local** file from **.env.example**.

If you want to define other environment, you can create configuration file in **env** directory, for example **env/.env.prod** file.

An .env file contains following properties :

- **lifecompanion.framework.server.url** :path to update server to download/upload updates
- **lifecompanion.framework.server.login** : login to connect to update server and upload update
- **lifecompanion.framework.server.password** : password to connect to update server and upload update
- **lifecompanion.app.server.url** : path to LifeCompanion website
- **lifecompanion.app.server.query.parameters** : useful to add a query parameter to each app server request (can be left empty)
- **lifecompanion.app.server.public_key** : public key for LifeCompanion website API

### Env var configuration

#### On dev env

- **HEROKU_API_KEY** : if you need to publish server builds (Heroku API key should be generated on your account)
- **LIFECOMPANION_JDK_JFX_PATH** : will contains platforms JDK and JavaFX binaries (to publish updates). This variable is optionnal, if not specified, default path is **~/.lifecompanion-jdk-jfx**

#### On server env (you may need to create these on your dev. env when needed)

- **DATABASE_URL** : (generated by heroku ) database URL (example : *postgres://username:password@host:port/database_name*) or create by dev. on local machine
- **JWT_SECRET** : JWT secret to generate auth. tokens
- **LC_PLATFORM_API_TOKEN** : API token to call stats API
- **LC_PLATFORM_URL** : URL for stats API (example *https://lifecompanionaac.org*)
- **LC_PLATFORM_URL_PASSWORD** : (optionnal) query parameters to append to LC_PLATFORM_URL (example *?app_password=password*)
- **AMAZON_S3_BUCKET** : Amazon S3 bucket
- **AMAZON_S3_ACCES_KEY** : Amazon S3 access key
- **AMAZON_S3_SECRET** : Amazon S3 secret
- **AMAZON_S3_REGION** : Amazon S3 region (example *eu-west-3*)

## Creating updates

**This part is meant to be read by official developpers and is not needed by anyone who just want to contribute.**

**Most of this logic in implemented with [GitHub actions on official repository](../.github/workflows) so these tasks are not run on developer env.**

All task bellow are depending on a destination environment and should be run with `-Penv=dev` or `-Penv=prod` argument (on Gradle task) if you want to target other env. than local. Content of the task should also be adapted to destination env (e.g. tags)

Creating updates depends on custom Gradle task and plugin, all located in *lifecompanion/buildSrc*

### Create LifeCompanion update

*When file are too big for direct upload during update (e.g. image zips, file > 100 MB), file should be uploaded manually in file storage and then linked with `PRESET_STORAGE_IDS` in `PublishApplicationTask`*

1. Check `lifecompanion.app.version` in *lifecompanion/gradle.properties*
1. Check `visibility` in *lifecompanion/gradle.properties*, it can be PREVIEW, PUBLISHED or HIDDEN
1. Check path for file to unzip : `TO_UNZIP_PATH` in *PublishApplicationTask*
1. Check path for file with manual storage : `PRESET_STORAGE_IDS` in *PublishApplicationTask*
1. Commit and tag repo with **lifecompanion/lc-app/X.X.X-prod**
1. Run `gradlew :lc-app:publishApplication -Penv=prod` in **lifecompanion**

### Create LifeCompanion installer update

*Installer updates should be generated on Windows as InnoSetup is used to generated the installer exe*

1. Check `lifecompanion.installer.version` in *lifecompanion/gradle.properties*
1. Check `visibility` in *lifecompanion/gradle.properties*, it can be PREVIEW, PUBLISHED or HIDDEN
1. Commit and tag repo with **lifecompanion/lc-installer/X.X.X-prod**
1. Run `gradlew :lc-installer:publishInstaller -Penv=prod` in **lifecompanion**

### Deploy LifeCompanion server update in production

#### Prepare a LifeCompanion server

1. Create Heroku app and Amazon S3 storage bucket
1. Add postgres on Heroku
1. Configure Heroku app with env var (see env var part)
1. Generate your login and password hash (for password hash, use `System.out.println(BCrypt.hashpw("password",BCrypt.gensalt()));`)
```
INSERT INTO app_user(id,login,password,role) VALUES ('A_RANDOM_UUID','MY_LOGIN','MY_PASSWORD_HASHED','ADMIN');
INSERT INTO application(id) VALUES ('lifecompanion');
```
*Example for admin/password (you can use that for your local env)*
```
INSERT INTO app_user(id,login,password,role) VALUES ('dbb0fd9b-bc96-4395-ab4b-f3b583c5fddf','admin','$2a$10$lxaKVIrNPOm8vg7YODdVBuBnMUDSIPAsrEP6cUEei0hXN0romnSUW','ADMIN');
INSERT INTO application(id) VALUES ('lifecompanion');
```

#### Create LifeCompanion server update

*Note on env : for the specific case of LifeCompanion update server, note that we always publish in dev as the dev application is then promoted to prod on Heroku*

1. Update server version in build.gradle if needed
1. Check your scripts in **src/main/resources/sql/migrations** and add them to `DataSource.MIGRATIONS_SCRIPT_NAMES`
1. Check that you have the correct **HEROKU_API_KEY** env variable
1. Commit and tag repo with **lifecompanion-framework/lc-framework-server/X.X.X**
1. Run `gradlew :lc-framework-server:publishServerUpdate -Penv=dev` in **lifecompanion-framework**
1. If you have migration scripts, you can check them in Heroku log

## LifeCompanion application and launcher arguments

- **-updateDownloadFinished** : launch application from "update" directory
- **-updateFinished** : launch application normally, just delete the update directory
- **-enablePreviewUpdates** : enable preview versions for updates

## Update mechanism

1. Application is launched, running application detect if an update is available
1. If update available, copy previous **application** directory in **update** directory + download updated file
1. Once finished, update state is set to **DONE**
1. On next launcher launch, this launch application in **update** folder
1. Launched application knows it was updated (cmd arg flag) : block UI, copy its own content into **application** folder
1. Once content is copied, restart launcher with a fag to launch the up to date application in **application** folder
1. Launched application knows update is finished (cmd arg flag) : delete **update** directory
