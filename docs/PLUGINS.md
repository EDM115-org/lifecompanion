## App icons

A good pratice to integrate icons in LifeCompanion is to save SVG of your icons and to only integrate the good sized icons into your app resources. Recommanded size are always based on the max. width/height : if your icon ratio is 3/4, for a 32x32 size your icon should be 24*32.

Original LifeCompanion SVG icons can be found in **res/icons**

Here are the LifeCompanion expected icons size :

| TYPE												| SIZE (PX)			|
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
|**use actions / use event generator**				|32x32				|
