## LifeCompanion application and launcher arguments

- **-updateDownloadFinished** : launch application from "update" directory
- **-updateFinished** : launch application normally, just delete the update directory
- **-enablePreviewUpdates** : enable preview versions for updates

## Update mechanism

1. Application is launched, running application detect if an update is available
1. If update available, copy previous **application** directory in **update** directory + download updated file
1. Once finished, update state is set to **DONE**
1. On next launcher launch, this launch application in **update** folder
1. Launched application knows it was updated (cmd arg flag) : block UI, copy its own content into **application** folder
1. Once content is copied, restart launcher with a fag to launch the up to date application in **application** folder
1. Launched application knows update is finished (cmd arg flag) : delete **update** directory
